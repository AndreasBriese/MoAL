Mother of All Learning - an uber list of Comp Science / Engineering tasks and the actual implementations taken from Quora notes or manually compiled to master computer science.

__See [the tasks](TASKS.md) for more details__

**Goals: THIS SHOULD ALL BE DONE IN PYTHON, EXCEPT FOR SPECIFIC LANGUAGE GOALS!
Also: things that are math oriented, should still be done IN an actual language -- utilize tools like numpy, scipy to do different types of math.**

Some examples are taken and recreated from other sites. To learn, you should still manually
recreate each example, so you can get a better intuition and memorization of how it works and how to do it.

In some cases, direct programming makes little sense, since a given subject may be high level. However, to better understand and cement the idea, it's important to try and recreate it in code. For example, you can learn about memory, but to "grok" it, you could write a module that acts as if it was memory - with the same kind of properties.

**This should be considered a living document, that may grow in size as new details and fields of study are added**
