Mother of All Learning - an uber list of Comp Science / Engineering tasks and the actual implementations taken from Quora notes or manually compiled to master computer science. The goal here is to represent atomic tasks that can be easily recreated and implemented in real code, since the goal is to learn both theory and practice, while practicing the entire time (and thus cementing the concepts better).

Each task is meant to be simple and atomic, so there is freedom to approach it however is most comfortable for a given learning style. Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle; while it's important to get the breadth and depth that makes a degree worthwhile, pieces are constantly being filled in, and this can be done line by line (linearly), or in a completely random fashion (or anything in-between).

**This should be considered a living document. It will grow in size, becoming better organized as new details and fields of study are integrated**

__Enough talk! See [the tasks](TASKS.md) for more details__

## Motivations
The very first list was originally taken from: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-self-teach-the-skills-and-knowledge-gained-in-a-typical-computer-science-degree/answer/Sam-Park-1?srid=dDmF&share=1, but it has been greatly expanded and re-organized. This will probably continue to change, which is why the atomic, containerization approach for each task is so important.

## Goals
**To my end,** this should all be done in python, except for specific language goals. Things that are math/theory oriented, should still be done IN an actual language -- utilize tools like numpy, scipy to do different types of math if necessary.

Some examples are taken and/or recreated from other sites. In these cases, they are not copy-pasted verbatim; they are re-typed, character-by-character, modified, and heavily commented; the goal is not rote memorization. The goal is a genuine understanding and better intuition of how it works and how to do it. You may find it useful to recreate, modify, or start from scratch -- it is recommended to start from scratch when possible, but if you are honest with yourself, you will "know" when you comprehend it.

As mentioned before, in some cases, direct programming makes little sense since a given subject may be high level. However, to better understand and cement the idea, **it's important to try and recreate it in code**. For example, you can /learn/ about memory, but to **grok** it, you could write an actual module that acts as if it was memory - with the same kind of properties and functionality, albeit higher level.

## Accomplishing these tasks

### Strategy: "20 minutes a day"
Whatever works best for you. but the '20 minute a day' approach is a good place to start. Specifically, [you can read about it here](http://www.quora.com/What-small-lifestyle-changes-have-the-biggest-impact/answer/Evan-DeFilippis?srid=dDmF&share=1). I find this approach helps get you motivated when the task seems daunting or your strapped for time -- 20 minutes is something anyone can commit to, and you'll be surprised how much can be accomplished when taken in aggregate.
