Welcome to MoAL's documentation!
================================

Mission statement:
'MoAL - aka "Mother of All Learning" is a personal vision and project of mine, where the goal is to synthesize an extremely large set of computer science, software engineering, and computational science/math competencies into basic components, allowing one to learn a typically unfathomable breadth of topics in the field, doing so in a shorter amount of time.'

See the `README <https://github.com/christabor/MoAL/blob/master/README.md>`_ for a better explanation.
