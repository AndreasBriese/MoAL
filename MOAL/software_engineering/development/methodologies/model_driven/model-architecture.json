// Model Driven Design is based on the notion of creating models of your
// software application in advance, incorporating business requirements and domain
// experience, while iterating on these models until a reasonable
// version can be used to springboard programming efforts, and reduce error,
// while improving software outcomes and quality. The idea is not new,
// having been around in some form or another for quite some time.

// The most commonly used examples for modeling systems in advance of development
// is the old faithful Unified Modeling Language. There are some python modules
// and plenty of resources to handle, parse, or otherwise create UML, but I have
// found it is a cumbersome specification for most developers, including myself,
// and often requires specialized training just to learn it in the first place.

// Instead, I've opted for my own version of a model specification in the form
// of JSON configurations. The most important notion here is the crux of the idea:
// modeling your business requirements, UI, and/or application requirements
// in some non-code based form, and then once completed,
// using that as a guide for creating software.
//
// I've used a sort of informal but concise/consistent syntax here, using JSON.
// isA, hasA, hasMany, hasFunctions, and hasProperties seems
// to cover most all scenarios, but can be augmented. This might then
// be parsed and output in some kind of code generation step.

// See also: http://agilemodeling.com/essays/modelStorming.htm for some examples
// of "Just-in-time" modeling.
