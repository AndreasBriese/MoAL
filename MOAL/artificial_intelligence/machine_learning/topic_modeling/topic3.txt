Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degree holders were among the top earners in a new ranking of bachelor-level majors by PayScale.

Computer science degrees performed especially well in the rankings of 319 bachelor-level majors based on how much money graduates make in their early and mid-careers, with several computer science degrees in the top 25, all of which saw median wages of more than $100,000.

Petroleum and nuclear engineering were the top-earning majors, with mid-career median wages of $168,000 and $121,000, respectively. Computer science & engineering took the number six spot, with mid-career earnings of $115,000. It was followed by systems engineering and electrical & computer engineering, which tied for seventh place with mid-career earnings of $114,000. Computer engineering was tied with mining engineering at number 10 with mid-career earnings of $109,000, while computer science & mathematics was tied at number 14 with aerospace engineering, both offering mid-career earnings of $107,000. Basic computer science degrees ranked at number 18, offering early career median earnings of $63,100 and mid-career median pay of $105,000.
