## Long term engineering learning path aka “MOAL” - Mother of All Learning

Mostly taken from: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-self-teach-the-skills-and-knowledge-gained-in-a-typical-computer-science-degree/answer/Sam-Park-1?srid=dDmF&share=1

**THIS SHOULD ALL BE DONE IN PYTHON, EXCEPT FOR SPECIFIC LANGUAGE GOALS!
Also: things that are math oriented, should still be done IN an actual language -- utilize tools like numpy, scipy to do different types of math.**

**This should be considered a living document, that may grow in size as new details and fields of study are added**
